    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient retrieval, \n",
    "manipulation, and management. It is designed to store and manage large amounts of data and provide \n",
    "mechanisms for querying, updating, and analyzing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database \n",
    "management systems, each with its own characteristics and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Structure: SQL databases are based on a relational model, where data is organized into tables \n",
    "             with predefined schemas. Tables consist of rows and columns, and relationships can \n",
    "             be established between tables.\n",
    "2.Schema and Flexibility: SQL databases enforce a rigid schema, meaning the structure of the data\n",
    "                          must be defined in advance. Changes to the schema can be complex and \n",
    "                          require careful planning. However, this ensures data consistency and \n",
    "                          integrity.\n",
    "3.Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for interacting with the data.\n",
    "                  SQL provides a declarative approach to querying and manipulating data, allowing \n",
    "                  users to specify what they want without worrying about how to retrieve it.\n",
    "4.ACID Transactions: SQL databases typically support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) \n",
    "                     properties, which ensure that database transactions are reliable, consistent, \n",
    "                     and durable.\n",
    "5.Scaling: SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased \n",
    "           load by upgrading the hardware (e.g., adding more powerful servers).\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Structure: NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, \n",
    "             or graph. They provide flexibility by allowing data to be stored without a predefined\n",
    "             schema, making them suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "2.Schema and Flexibility: NoSQL databases are schema-less or have flexible schemas, allowing the \n",
    "                          structure of the data to evolve over time. This makes them more agile when \n",
    "                          dealing with dynamic or evolving data.\n",
    "3.Query Language: NoSQL databases may use different query languages, such as MongoDB's query language \n",
    "                  for document databases or Cassandra Query Language (CQL) for columnar databases. \n",
    "                  These query languages often provide rich functionality for working with specific data \n",
    "                  models.\n",
    "4.CAP Theorem: NoSQL databases are designed based on the CAP (Consistency, Availability, \n",
    "               Partition tolerance) theorem, which states that in distributed systems, it is \n",
    "               impossible to achieve all three properties simultaneously. NoSQL databases often \n",
    "               prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency.\n",
    "5.Scaling: NoSQL databases are generally horizontally scalable, meaning they can handle increased \n",
    "           load by adding more machines to distribute the data and workload across a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of an application. \n",
    "SQL databases are commonly used when data consistency and transactions are crucial, and the data has \n",
    "a well-defined structure. NoSQL databases are often preferred when dealing with large-scale, dynamic, \n",
    "or unstructured data, where flexibility and scalability are more important than strict consistency."

    "\n",
    "2.Non-Null: A primary key must have a value for every record. It cannot be NULL or empty.\n",

    "                                  multiple columns. In the case of a composite key, the \n",
